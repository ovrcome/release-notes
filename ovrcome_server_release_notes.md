  In line with our new operating procedure for software development, we'll begin to create releases with notes for each deploy to production. Version numbers will follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) format.
  As this is the first release, it contains nearly 800 commits dating back to March 2023, implementing our Clinician Portal and associated API to be used by the mobile app.
  Relative to what's currently in production, this release restructures how we store subscriptions and trials in our database, and introduces a new approach to trial subscriptions for standalone headsets that will provide more flexibility for customers.
- Includes standalone headset VR web app at version 0.15.2
- Includes live session VR web app at version 0.7.0
